# DevOps 1st interview HW
This repository includes the 2 assignments I got after my first interview at for a python DevOps position.<br />

I was required to choose and answer 1 of the assignment and send an answer within 72 hours.<br />
Because I wasn't very familiar with the tools to complete the assignment I googled a lot.<br />

2 hours before the deadline I submitted my answers to both assignments.<br />

Used Languages: **Phyton**<br />
