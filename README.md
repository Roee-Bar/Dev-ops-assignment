# Elbit DevOps 1st interview HW
This repository includes the 2 assignments I got after my first interview at Elbit systems for a python DevOps position.
I was required to choose and answer 1 of the assignment and send an answer within 72 hours

I googled a lot because I was very familiar with the tools to complete the assignment.

2 hours before the deadline I submitted my answers to both assignments.
