# DevOps 1st interview assignment
This repository includes the 2 assignments I got after my first interview at for a python DevOps position.<br />

I was required to choose and answer 1 of the assignment and send an answer within 72 hours.<br />
Because I wasn't very familiar with the tools at the time, to complete the assignment I googled a lot.<br />

2 hours before the deadline I submitted my answers to both assignments.<br />

Used Languages: **Phyton**<br />
Used Libraries: **BeautifulSoup, Requests**

**Assignments 1** : write a function in python that uses an address to read the content of the book and returns the 20 most frequent in the book in the included format

**Assignments 2** : write a function in python that receives a list of cities in the world (list of strings), and returns a tuple of 2 strings: the city with the current lowest temperature and the city with the current highest temperature (you need to find a website that gives temperature data of cities around the world, uses it and receive real-time answers when running the function)
